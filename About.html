            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello! I'm Anju, an MCA student passionate about coding and web development. I have a deep interest in learning new technologies and building innovative solutions that can make a difference. My journey in the world of technology started during my B.Sc. in Computer Science and now, through my MCA studies, I am sharpening my skills to dive deeper into the tech world.</p><br>

            <p>I'm passionate about solving complex problems through programming and I enjoy creating responsive and interactive websites. My curiosity and drive to learn keep me constantly exploring new tools and technologies, from C++ to java and more. I'm also actively working on improving my knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms to become a better problem solver.</p><br>
            
            <p>In addition to coding, I love taking on new challenges, whether it's improving my understanding of software development or collaborating on team projects. I'm always eager to learn, grow and contribute to innovative tech solutions.</p><br>
