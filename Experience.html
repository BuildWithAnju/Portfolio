            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
               During my B.Sc. in Computer Science, I gained a solid understanding of core subjects such as C, C++, HTML, CSS, DBMS, RDBMS, DSA and Computer Fundamentals. This helped me develop a strong foundation in programming, logical thinking and problem-solving.<br>
               Currently, as part of my MCA program, I have expanded my technical knowledge to include Java, which has further enhanced my programming expertise.<br>
               Alongside my academics, I also provided home tuition to students, which helped me develop strong communication and time management skills and taught me how to effectively prioritize tasks and meet deadlines under pressure.<br>
